- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @york135 (Jun-You Wang), a PhD student (now PhD candidate) in MIRLAB, National Taiwan University.
- ðŸ‘€ My research interests include several MIR tasks related to **singing voice**, including singing transcription, singing voice synthesis, singing voice conversion, lyrics transcription/alignment. My google scholar page is: [https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-TW&user=2cIdit0AAAAJ](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-TW&user=2cIdit0AAAAJ).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Japanese, English writing, and novel writing.
- ðŸ“« You can send an e-mail to reach me (junyou.wang@mirlab.org).
- I understand English, Mandarin/Chinese, and Japanese (though I'm still not good at writing in Japanese), so feel free to contact me in these languages. I may reply in either English or traditional Chinese.
- I am currently responsible for maintaining the **MIR-ST500 dataset**. Feel free to ask me any question about that dataset :)
